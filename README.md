The first application from the book "Pharo 9 by example"
----------------------------------------
The game board consists of a rectangular array of light yellow cells. When you click on one of the cells, the four surrounding cells turn blue. Click again, and they toggle back to light yellow. The object of the game is to turn as many cells blue as possible.
